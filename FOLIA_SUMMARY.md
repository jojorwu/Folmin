Folia is a fork of the PaperMC server software, designed to significantly improve scalability on modern hardware. Its core feature is regionised multithreading, which allows the server to distribute workload across multiple CPU cores by processing different regions of the game world concurrently. This makes Folia particularly well-suited for servers with many players spread out across large worlds, or those running on machines with a high number of CPU cores, as it can more effectively utilize available processing power. However, this architectural change means that plugins for PaperMC will likely require adaptation to function correctly with Folia.
